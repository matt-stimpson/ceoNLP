# NLP Historical Analysis of Outside CEO Hires

In this project, I apply classifiers to news articles announcing CEO hires to understand why outside CEOs were considered valuable in different decades since 1950 at large, public US corporations.

•	Analyzed feature importance scores from classifiers (support vector machines and random forests) to identify ngrams that characterized descriptions of outside CEOs in different decades.

•	Assessed interpretability of classifiers by comparing feature importance scores across classifiers and within classifiers across subsamples, and by triangulating against close readings of articles.
