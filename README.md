# NLP Historical Analysis of Outside CEO Hires

In this project, I apply NLP classifiers to news articles announcing CEO hires to understand why outside CEOs were considered valuable in different decades over the past half century at large, public US corporations.

•	Analyzed feature importance scores from classifiers (support vector machines and random forests) to identify ngrams that characterized descriptions of outside CEOs in different decades.

•	Compared machine learning results to close readings of a subset of CEO announcement articles.
